 # APCSPfinal
final project for apcsp

Authors: Max Goad and Richard Zins

This code will run a website that allows users to create rooms in which multiple people can draw on the screen. The drawing is updated in real time across all connected users.

Server programming done with express.js and socket.io.

This project also served as my(max) real intro to really killer-looking css work.
